                The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
                 It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
                 HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.

            <p>
                CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
                 This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification
                  of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant
                   CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable
                    the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
